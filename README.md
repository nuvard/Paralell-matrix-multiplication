# Parallel-matrix-multiplication
Implementation of several parallel matrix multiplication algorithms using OpenMP and MPI

I tested these algorithms on 8 processors, Fox and Cannon algorithms on 4 processors.  Information about performance and pseudocode will appear soon.
## OpenMP
1. Naive matrix multiplication
1. Band algorithm
1. Cannon algorithm

## MPI
1. Fox algorithm
1. Cannon algorithm

## Soon:
1. Strassen algorithm
1. Karatsuba algorithm
1. ???
